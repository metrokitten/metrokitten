## About Me

Hello! I'm **MetroKitten/Metro/Metr**, a Turkish student who is passionate, sarcastic and determined to make stuff. I am religiously in favor of cats 😼 I spend most of my time doing random stuff, such as studying, website building, Discord development/jobs (part-time), game modding, messing with my laptop and music. Sometimes I even act like I am not being censored on the Internet, but I am, so have that (but thanks to my friend [deka](https://0x64656b61.pages.dev/) I almost am free of govermental restrictions :D).

Also, I have a personal website of my own: <https://metrokitten.nekoweb.org>. If you would like to see MetrOS, go check it out!

## Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🍭 [Candy Crush Forever!](https://github.com/metrokitten/CandyCrushForever)

Candy Crush Forever is a web-based platform that combines a powerful Level Editor and a functional Web Player for creating and playing custom Candy Crush Saga levels — all in your browser!

### 💢 [File Sandbox](https://github.com/metrokitten/File-Sandbox)

My goal is to discover every file extension in the world. This repository contains a lot of file extensions. All files contain their respective code blocks showcasing the unique characteristics of each extension. Enjoy exploring! Don't get lost :P

### 🇪🇺 [e-Twinning Knowledge Base](https://github.com/metrokitten/eTwinning-Knowledge-Base)

A simple knowledge base application for the European Union's eTwinning project. The project can be used by anyone on the platform, independently of any Twinspace. Kind of, not developed anyone until I get the time/reason to do so.

### 🌐 [Nationdex TypeScript](https://github.com/Nationdex-Team/Nationdex-TypeScript)

Nationdex is a Discord bot inspired by the Pokédex, where users can catch, trade, and manage Nations! Developed by me, [Ariel Aram](https://arielaram.com/) and [Aditya](https://adityaa.xyz/), built with TypeScript and the Seyfert framework, it features a modular command/event system, a MongoDB database backend (via Prisma ORM), and TOML-based configuration.

### 🌍🌎🌏 Earthy

Earthy is a mobile/web app aiming to provide users with critical earthquake alerts.
